This work is based on:
- [Infinity ∞ : Scaling Bitwise AutoRegressive Modeling for High-Resolution Image Synthesis](https://github.com/FoundationVision/Infinity)  
- [CAR🚗: Controllable AutoRegressive Modeling for Visual Generation](https://github.com/MiracleDance/CAR)  

Huge thanks to my senior [Theo the Bear](https://github.com/theohsiung) for all the support and advice.
